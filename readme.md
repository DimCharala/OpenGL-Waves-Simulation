# OpenGL Wave Simulation
This project was created for the 'Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality' course in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Patras. It was completed in the Winter semester of the 2023-2024 academic year. The goal of this project was to simulate wave movement in OpenGL using Gerstner Waves.

> The library used in this work was developed by the Visualization & Virtual Reality Group at the University of Patras. For any use of this library, please contact the group via [this link](https://www.vvr.ece.upatras.gr/contact/).
